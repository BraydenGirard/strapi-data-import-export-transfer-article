## What is Strapi

Strapi is an open-source headless CMS based on Node.js that is used to develop and manage content using a Restful API and/or GraphQL.

With Strapi, we can scaffold our API faster and consume the content via APIs using any HTTP client or GraphQL enabled frontend.

## Scaffolding a Strapi project

To scaffold a new Strapi project is very simple and works precisely as installing a new frontend framework.

We are going to start by running the following commands and testing them out in our default browser.

```javascript
npx create-strapi-app strapi-api --quickstart
# OR
yarn create strapi-app strapi-api --quick start
```

The command above will scaffold a new strapi project in the directory you specified.

Next, run yarn build to build your app and yarn develop to run the new project if it doesn't start automatically.

The last command will open a new tab with a page to register your new admin of the system. Go ahead and fill out the form and click on the submit button to create a new Admin.
